    <h2>Low and Slow</h2>
    <p>posted by BGB, November 15,2016</p>
    <p>This week I'm particularly excited about a new cooking technique called <i>sous vide</i>. In <i>sous vide</i> cooking you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked. In his book, <i>Cooking for Geeks</i>, Jeff Potter descibes it as "ultr-low-temperature poaching.</p>
    <p>Next week we will be serving <b><i>Sous Vide</i> Salmon with Dill Hollandaise.</b> To reserve a table at the chef table, contact us before November 30.</p>
